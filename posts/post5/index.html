      <p>Today I had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Bowring to delve deeper into XML and binary serialization. Dr. Bowring provided invaluable guidance on how to structure the code by creating separate classes outside the main program. Additionally, we reviewed my JUnit testing for these new classes to ensure accuracy and identify any discrepancies. This blog post will walk you through our discussion and highlight the progress we made towards developing a multi-modular Gradle project for my movie class, paving the way for an exciting GUI application using JavaFX.</p>
<p><strong>XML and Binary Serialization:</strong>    <br>
Serialization is a crucial aspect of modern programming, allowing us to convert objects into a format suitable for storage or transmission. Today, we focused on XML and binary serialization techniques. Dr. Bowring shared expert tips on creating dedicated classes outside the main program to handle these serialization tasks efficiently. This approach not only improves code organization but also enhances reusability and maintainability.</p>
<p>Ensuring the correctness of our code is of utmost importance. Dr. Bowring took the time to review my JUnit tests for the newly created classes. This thorough examination aimed to identify any discrepancies or errors that might hinder the functionality of the serialization process. By following best practices in testing, we can confidently deliver reliable and robust code.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Modular Gradle Project:</strong>    <br>
Taking our progress into account, Dr. Bowring introduced me to the concept of a multi-modular Gradle project. We started by creating two modules: &ldquo;core&rdquo; and &ldquo;app&rdquo; (leveraging the power of JavaFX). This modular approach allows for a clear separation of concerns and facilitates better project organization. The &ldquo;core&rdquo; module acts as the foundation, containing the essential classes for the movie set serialization project. The &ldquo;app&rdquo; module, on the other hand, focuses on the GUI aspect, employing JavaFX to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.</p>
<p>With the groundwork laid, I was assigned the exciting task of diving into JavaFX and initiating the GUI side of the project. JavaFX is a powerful framework for building cross-platform desktop applications, known for its rich set of graphical controls and seamless integration with Java. The prospect of creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface for our movie set serialization project has ignited my curiosity and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Conclusion:
Today&rsquo;s meeting with Dr. Bowring was incredibly productive. We explored XML and binary serialization techniques, ensuring our code is structured efficiently and tested thoroughly. The introduction of a multi-modular Gradle project lays the foundation for our upcoming GUI application, built with the help of JavaFX. As I embark on this exciting journey of GUI development, I am eager to apply the knowledge and guidance provided by Dr. Bowring. Stay tuned for further updates on the progress of our movie set serialization project and the evolution of our JavaFX-based GUI.</p>
